## My process

### Built with

- Javascript

### What I learned

Over the course creating this webpage i learned how to work with function and if and else elements

```Javascript
function closepopup() {
  popup.classList.remove("open-popup");
  //   loginPage.classList.remove("removelogin-page");
}
```

### Continued development

I want to focus on how to use the event listener element in Javascript...
